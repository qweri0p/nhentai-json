# nhentai-json
NHentai data dump in json.

I'm not sure how I should do this right now. What I'll do first is make a program create one or more JSON dumps with all data.
I think that's the best idea I have right now.
Make a docker compose file to run both the app as well as the FlareSolverr server.
